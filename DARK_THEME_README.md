# Dark Theme Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the dark theme implementation for the AI Bloodwork Analysis application. The dark theme was designed to improve readability, reduce eye strain, and create a more modern and professional look for the application.

## Color Palette

The dark theme uses the following color palette:

- **Background Colors**:
  - Primary Background: `bg-gray-900` (Very dark gray, almost black)
  - Secondary Background: `bg-gray-800` (Dark gray)
  - Card Background: `bg-gray-800` or custom `card-dark` class
  - Input Background: `bg-gray-800`

- **Text Colors**:
  - Primary Text: `text-white` (For headings and important text)
  - Secondary Text: `text-gray-300` (For regular text)
  - Muted Text: `text-gray-400` (For less important text)
  - Very Muted Text: `text-gray-500` (For placeholder text)

- **Border Colors**:
  - Primary Border: `border-gray-700` (For most borders)
  - Secondary Border: `border-gray-600` (For highlighted borders)

- **Accent Colors**:
  - Primary Accent: `text-primary-400` to `text-primary-600` (Indigo shades)
  - Secondary Accent: `text-secondary-400` to `text-secondary-600` (Teal shades)

## Component Styling

### Layout Component
- Uses `bg-gray-900` for the main background
- Text color is set to `text-gray-100` for good contrast

### Cards
- Use the `card-dark` class which provides:
  - Dark background (`bg-gray-800`)
  - Border (`border-gray-700`)
  - Rounded corners (`rounded-lg`)
  - Subtle hover effect

### Buttons
- Primary buttons: `btn btn-primary` (Indigo background)
- Secondary buttons: `btn btn-secondary` (Teal background)
- Outline buttons: `btn btn-outline` (Transparent with border)

### Form Elements
- Inputs have dark backgrounds (`bg-gray-800`)
- Borders use `border-gray-700`
- Focus states use primary color ring (`focus:ring-primary-500`)

### Progress Indicators
- Use primary colors for active states
- Use gray colors for inactive states
- Animations maintain visibility on dark backgrounds

## Implementation Details

### Upload Page
- Tab navigation uses border indicators for active state
- Cards use the `card-dark` class for consistent styling
- Icons are used to improve visual hierarchy

### Upload Form
- Drag-and-drop area uses dark styling with dashed borders
- Progress bar changes color based on upload stage
- Error and success states use appropriate icons and colors

### Results Dashboard
- Charts use dark theme colors for grid lines and ticks
- Tab navigation for different sections
- Status indicators use appropriate colors (red, yellow, green)

### Chat Interface
- Chat bubbles use different colors for user and assistant
- User messages use primary color background
- Assistant messages use dark gray background
- Loading indicators use primary color with animation

## Accessibility Considerations

- Text contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- Interactive elements have clear focus states
- Color is not the only indicator of state or information
- Icons are used alongside text for better comprehension

## Future Enhancements

- Add user preference for light/dark theme
- Implement smooth transitions between themes
- Create more sophisticated data visualizations optimized for dark backgrounds
- Add more subtle animations and micro-interactions

## Implementation Notes

The dark theme was implemented using Tailwind CSS classes. The approach focused on:

1. Consistency across components
2. Appropriate contrast for readability
3. Visual hierarchy through color and spacing
4. Modern, professional aesthetic

No custom CSS was required beyond what was already in the `custom.css` file, which already included dark theme support for scrollbars, cards, and other elements.
